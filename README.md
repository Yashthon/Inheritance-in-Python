1. ROT13 is a weak form of encryption that involves “rotating” each letter in a word by
13 places. To rotate a letter means to shift it through the alphabet, wrapping around to
the beginning if necessary, so ’A’ shifted by 3 is ’D’ and ’Z’ shifted by 1 is ’A’. Write
a function called rotate_word that takes a string and an integer as parameters, and that
returns a new string that contains the letters from the original string “rotated” by the
given amount. For example, “cheer” rotated by 7 is “jolly” and “melon” rotated by -
10 is “cubed”. You might want to use the built-in functions ord, which converts a
character to a numeric code, and chr, which converts numeric codes to characters

2. Write a function called has_no_e that returns True if the given word doesn’t have the
letter “e” in it. Modify your program to print only the words that have no “e” and
compute the percentage of the words in the list have no “e.

3. Two words are anagrams if you can rearrange the letters from one to spell the other.
Write a function called is_anagram that takes two strings and returns True if they are
Anagrams

4. Implement Binary Search tree using class

5. Using class implement:
Singly link list and all its operations

6. Write a program that takes a birthday as input and prints the user’s age and the
number of days, hours, minutes and seconds until their next birthday. Use Class

7. Write a Python program to get all possible unique subsets from a set of distinct
integers. Use class
